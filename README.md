#How I Finished a Half-Completed Website 

##Casestudy
The single-page website serves as a countdown and registration portal for individuals who wish to attend the Godly Single and Married Lagos Hangout.

###Problem
My client requested that I compile some code for him to see if it was working. I used CodePen to compile the code and confirmed that the code was okay. I observed that there was no concise visual hierarchy; the containers needed more space within and around them. The heading was not readable, and the contents did not follow the expected order. He wanted me to add the registration details 

###Solution
I had to 
- Work on the layout of the event information section
- Make the heading of each section distinct
- Use a grid layout where it is appropriate instead of a flexbox
- Move the social media contacts to the footer
- Change the generic div elements to semantic HTML5 elements 
- Add more space within the containers and outside the containers
- Add a call to action button
- Change the color of the main heading to make it readable

###Result
The following results were achieved
- Improved accessibility for users with disabilities, better SEO performance, and cleaner, more maintainable code because of the use of semantic HTML5 tags
- Simplified the users' journey and eliminated confusion, while providing my client with increased conversions, improved user engagement, and measurable results because of the CTA button added
- The space added in the design enhanced the site's visual appeal and established a sense of hierarchy that makes the content easier to scan and understand

##Conclusion
Ultimately, I was able to satisfy my client and deliver the job the very day he sent me the job brief. He said the site is looking good.
